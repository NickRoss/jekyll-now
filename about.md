I'm a professor of Data Science at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/faculty/nicholas-ross "My USF Homepage"). Before USF, I spent a number of years in the video game industry, primarily at two companies: TinyCo, which was purchased by [JamCity in 2016](https://www.jamcity.com/why-were-buying-tinyco/) and [Sega](https://www.sega.com/), though I also consulted for a number of different companies.

Currently, my primary responsibility is overseeing the [Practicum Program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science/practicums) at USF, which is a required, part-time 9-month internship for students in the [Masters of Data Science Program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science).
