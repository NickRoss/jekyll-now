### Introduction

Over the last (nearly) two decades I've spent quite a bit of time working with students to get jobs (or hiring students). During this time I have seen a _lot_ of different takes on what _you_ need to do to get a job. Most of the time these lists are good starts, but are usually written by people who have jobs and have a really biased take on how they got it.

After hearing for about the hundredth time that the only way to get a job is to do _X_, where _X_ was how someone's brother's girlfriend got a job at google, I've decided to write my own, comprehensive and useful version of this. So without further ado, here are *the only five things you can do to get a job*, in no particular order:

1. Network
1. Improve your documents
1. Prepare for Interviews
1. Apply for jobs
1. Market yourself

### Marginal Returns

Before going over each one individually, I want to state that the biggest mistake that I see people make in their job search is only working on the things that they are good at. For example, I enjoy writing and editing. This means my documents look amazing. Given a choice, *most people overinvest in what they enjoy most*. However, this is not a great strategy because there are [diminishing marginal returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lawofdiminishingmarginalreturn.asp) to most activities. 

If you are searching for jobs, which of the activities have you under- or over-invested in? Be honest with yourself. It's okay to recognize that you had self-promotion and so marketing yourself feels gross. Accept it, recognize it as a limitation and _spend some time on it_.

 
Onto each...

### 1. Network

Networking can take a lot of forms, but generally it means physically interacting with people. This means going to meetups, alumni events, trade shows, talks and career events. 

It's important to get your face out there so that people know who you are and what you are looking for. It's also a lot harder to say no to a person that you have met. 

A lot of people dislike networking (I am one of them), so try to find ways to network that are less icky for you. For myself, I enjoy going to technical meetups -- even in areas that I'm not as familiar with! At a bare minimum I'm learning about an area that I may not know about. Granted, this probably isn't as valuable as going to a data-centric meetup or a career fair for data science, but it is better than not going and there is a lot of overlap between data and general tech.

When I network I try to do specific things (and at least identify a few of them ahead of time). Am I here to get to know a particular company I know will be attendance? Am I here to catch up with a friend? What can I do to maximize this experience?
